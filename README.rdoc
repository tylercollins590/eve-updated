== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby library for interfacing with all aspects of the EVE Online MMO. It is designed for use within a Ruby on Rails
project, but does not require Rails as a dependency. That means there's nothing preventing you from writing a
stand-alone application or script using this library.

== QUICK START:

=== Including The Gem
In Rails 3:

  gem 'eve'

In Rails 2:

  # Please note that the Rails 2 version of this gem is no longer being maintained, so
  # you will need to download a 1.x version of the gem.
  config.gem 'eve', :version => "~> 1.0"
  
In Pure Ruby:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'eve'

=== Usage Example: Controller
  class MyEveCompatibleController < ApplicationController
    requires_trust
  end
  
Rails 3: This returns a blank page with a trust request. This behavior can be overridden with an initializer to provide custom trust request pages:
  module Eve
    module Trust
      module ControllerHelpers
        def require_trust(trust_message = self.class.trust_message)
          if igb? && !igb.trusted?
            render :text => "<center>Requires trust!</br><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"CCPEVE.requestTrust('http://#{request.host_with_port}/')\">give trust</a>", :layout => false
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end

=== Usage Example: View Helpers
  <%=link_to_evemail "Check Your Mail!"%>

  <%if igb.trusted?%>
    <p>Thanks for your trust! I see you're currently in <%=igb.solar_system_name%>.</p>
    <p>Here's some information about our secret headquarters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%=link_to_route "Click For Directions", "Jita"%></li>
      <li><%=link_to_map "Show On Map", "Jita"%></li>
    </ul>
  <%end%>

=== Usage Example: EVE API
  # Get the current server status
  api = Eve::API.new()
  server_status = api.server_status
  puts "Server reports status #{server_status.server_open ? "ONLINE" : "OFFLINE"}"
  puts "\tCurrent time is #{server_status.current_time}"
  puts "\t#{server_status.online_players} players currently online"
  puts
  #
  # Get a list of characters
  api = Eve::API.new(:user_id => $user_id, :api_key => $limited_api_key)
  result = api.account.characters
  puts "Choose a character:"
  result.characters.each_with_index { |char, index| puts "\t#{index}: #{char.name} (#{char.character_id})" }
  choice = gets.chomp.to_i
  puts
  #
  # Get the current training queue. Need a full API key and a character ID for that.
  api.set(:api_key => $full_api_key, :character_id => result.characters[choice].character_id)
  result = api.character.skill_queue
  result.skillqueue.each do |skill|
    result.skillqueue.columns.each do |column|
      print column.ljust(20), ":\t", skill[column], "\n"
    end
    puts
  end

== DETAILS:

This package is divided into 3 major components, and are listed below. Click on any item to see more information and
usage examples.

* API libraries: Eve::API
  * Handles interfacing with the EVE Online API. It allows you to easily query the server for various information about
    the server status, a given player, or his/her in-game character.
  * Eventually, this may be extended to incorporate other EVE-related APIs, such as the EVE-Central and EVE Metrics
    APIs.

* Controller helpers: Eve::Trust
  * There are several helper methods added to ActionController::Base, and they are designed to facilitate interaction
    with the in-game browser (IGB). In particular, these helpers allow you to establish trust with the client browser,
    which will then provide more information about the player's current in-game status (such as his/her current
    location).
  * The controller helpers also automatically detect whether the client is, in fact, using the EVE IGB, or whether they
    are using some other browser. If a view with the ".igb.erb" extension is found, the controller will render that view
    by default for IGB clients. If the client is using some other browser, or a view with the ".igb.erb" extension is
    not found, then the default view will be rendered instead.

* View helpers: Eve::Helpers::JavascriptHelper
  * There are several helper methods added to ActionView, and they are designed to facilitate easy and intuitive
    generation of proprietary IGB JavaScript calls.
  * These helpers are automatically made accessible to all instances of ActionView::Base.
  * To take advantage of these helpers, your application must make use of ActionView::Base, which is the default in Ruby
    on Rails.
